    <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>

<p>The Weather Routing Plugin is designed to
compute iteratively positions the boat could possibly make at
a certain time.  By merging the results of many calculations,
it is possible to form a map determining the quickest route
to any given location within the map.

<h3><u>Quick Start</u></h3>
Open the Weather Routing Dialog, then right click the map and Select "Weather Route Position"
Create Positions for both Start and End.  Next From the Configuration menu (next to File) Select
"New", and double click this configuration in the list to edit.  Enter the correct parameters,
and if needed edit the boat.  When done, you can close this window, and click "Start"

<h3><u>Warning</u></h3>
As of July 2, 2013, the algorithm exhibits a few major flaws which can result in suboptimal
routes.  Try increasing the time step and/or disabling currents to help mitigate these.

  <h3><u>Background</u></h3>

<p>Integration with the grib plugin (version 2.1 or later) allows for
knowledge of weather conditions.  The climatology plugin can also
provide a source of data for longer voyages.  In the case where data
is valid from both sources, grib will be choosen.  If current data is
available from climatology, and only wind from grib, then the grib wind
is used with the climatology current.

<p>The grib time selected on the timeline at the time the computation is
started can be syncronized.  From there, the grib timeline data is accessed
as the computation proceeds.  Once a computation is completed, the
course and position of the boat as it sails can be viewed during grib
playback.

<p>The Wind, Current and wave height data is read from the grib file.
If no Current or wave height is available, they are assumed to be 0.

<p>
The Supported Options Include:
<ul>
  <li><b>Degree Step</b> Difference in degrees between courses to attempt.  Less than 3 degrees
    between steps usually takes a long time to calculate and it is usually better to use a shorter
    time step instead.</li>
  <li><b>Time Step</b> Time in seconds to sail before attempting course change.</li>
  <li><b>Max Diverted Course</b> Maximum course error from heading toward target destination to attempt.
  If set to 180, the map will expand in all directions, and can be used to find multiple destinations
  from a given source.  If set less than 180, computation time is reduced (as it tends to take a very long
  time as the map expands), but possible courses which take directions on a bearing too far from the closest great circle route (even if just for 1 iteration) will be lost, and therefore the optimal route may not be achieved.
    finding routes</li>
  <li><b>Max Wind Knots</b> Do not navigate in areas with more wind than this value.</li>
  <li><b>Max Swell Meters</b> Do not attempt to navigate in areas with more wave average height than this value.</li>
  <li><b>Max Latitude</b> Do not navigate above (or below) this latitude.</li>
  <li><b>Tacking Time</b> Penalty for course change from one tack to the other in seconds.  This is normally irrelevant except for very close isochrons.  Setting to 0 avoids these calculations.  </li>
  <li><b>Detect Land</b> Use coastline data to avoid sailing through land</li>
  <li><b>Inverted Regons</b> This is relatively rare, but in some cases it may be
    possible to reach a destination further away in two or more different paths
    which go on either side of a closer position.   This can happen routing around
    islands, or occasionally when routing on either side of a high pressure system.
    The program must work inwards on this inverted region to reach a
    possible goal, if disabled these areas will be ignored.</li>
  <li><b>Anchoring</b>  In some cases, it may be preferable to anchor (assuming it
    isn't too deep) rather than navigate if going against a swift current as you
    may actually reach the destination sooner if holding still until the current abades.</li>
  <li><b>Allow Data Deficient</b> Continue to navigate on last valid wind data
    even if there is no more valid wind data in the area/time.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Boat</H3>

<p>
The boat dialog displays the polar plot of the boat's speed vs true wind direction as well as showing other details.  Two file types are supported.  CSV (same as qtVlm) and binary which is specific to this plugin.   The binary contains much more data.

<p>
The VMG tab shows the best courses for up and down wind on each tack.  Optimize Tacking makes the polar reflect these tacking options on the relevant courses.  If this option is chosen, then the boat will assume the ability to sail in these angles (it is assumed you can tack periodically to maintain this course)  If tacking is not optimized, then weather routing will naturally tack only at the isochrons, resulting in overlapping alternate routes, and potentially less optimal course (but will specifically display where to tack)  It also may take significantly longer to compute courses if there are rugged coastlines.  For this reason optiming tacking is recommended.

The boat configuration allows one to enter the parameters used to specify the performance of a boat.
Currently supported polar files are csv (same format as qtVlm) and binary files in this format
(specific only to this plugin)  These files specify sailing speed at each wind speed and wind direction.

<p>
It is also possible to compute boat polar from an augmented sailboat transform calculation.
The original sailboat transform:
<pre>
                                2
                  /  sin(A/2)  \
   sin(W) sin(A) |  ----------  | = VW eta
                  \ sin(W - A) /

W is true wind angle
A is apparent Wind angle
VW is true wind speed
eta is a boat specific constant specifying it's sailing efficiency.
</pre>
<p>Solving for boat speed based on apparent wind we get:
<pre>
                      __
                A    /VA
VB(inf) =  sin (-)  /---
                2 \/ eta
</pre>
<p>
This computation is very useful for the standard rig, but doesn't really apply correctly in many cases.  It also doesn't really factor in a huge range of variables as there is only one constant.

<p>I have augmented the sailboat transform to also take into account two types of drag in the hoppe that it may come closer to resembling the sailing characteristics of more vessels.  This way hull speed is properly taken into account, and for boats with planing ability, also you may get the right result if the correct values are used.

<p>The Frictional drag reduces the maximum speed based on the square of its speed.  The Wake drag component uses a complex math formula to compute the energy lost creating a wake:
<pre>
                                       2
           /      sin(Pi - F^-2)      \
   Drag = |  -----------------------   |
           \ (Pi - F^-2) (1 + Pi F^2) /

              ___
    V = F * \/g l

    F = sqrt(g * l) / V;

    g = 9.8 (gravity constant)
    l is length of vessel in meters
    V is meters per second

    Reaches a peak at F=Pi^-.5 which is about .56

    The huge increase starts at F = .4  (normal hull speed setting)
    
    Also interesting to note that at 80% of normal hull speed, the wave
    drag is zero as well, but the first hump occurs from .32 to .4, and
    therefore causes more drag than right at .4.

    This works for the full range from displacement to planing mode.
</pre>

<p>For many users, it may be best to enter measured values for the boat in csv format rather
than attempt to compute. Eventually it may even be possible to use the plugin to obtain
the polar values from gps during passage (given enough wind states).  It may also be eventually
supported to overlay the obtained data with the transform calculation to better optimize the
coefficents used to calculate it.

<p>The basic polar describing boat speed at various wind settings fails on many fronts.
First of all, various sail combinations become impractical in certain sea states,
even if the actual wind speed is the same.  The boat also does not sail the same
speed in these cases, so the actual boat speed may widely vary with identical wind
speed/direction values in different conditions.   Secondly, the wind is 3 dimensional,
and near land often has a strong vertical component.  Thirdly, there may be certain
areas conditions, or times when the user may selectively want to essentially use
a different polar diagram (sail plan, navigating in fog or near ice, night vs day,
autopilot vs wind vane)  Fourthly, the actual speed of the boat may change due
to various parameters besides currents, wind, and sea state for various reasons
(more on this below)  Fifthly.. wait I have like 10 of these I'll stop now.

<p>There is also extension for the possibility of other sources of propulsion
besides wind power (namely PV-solar electric) which  may be
used in conjunction with sails.  This form of power falls into the category of weather
routing as it is dependent on solar radiation.  Finally, it may be possible to store
some of this radiation, (during day with sun and wind) or in the case of anchoring in
an adverse tidal flow with a hydro generator in the form of chemical energy to be used
later (at night or when the tide is right) in an electric drive to reach the final destination
at a sooner possible time than any other method employed.
(all of this is mostly still unimplemented, but there is some c++)

<p>It is also possible to factor slow changing, but important changes to the boat's
passage-making ability over the course of the voyage.  One example is bottom growth,
and the rate it might grow given the sailing course and various parameters.  This
would enable you to gauge how essential it is to actually paint a bottom, or if
you don't mind (as I have done) to dive and scrape mid-ocean every week or two,
you might be able to actually determine how much time it would save (usually more
than the time spent swimming).  There is also the case of sails losing shape, and
becoming less efficient over the course of a long upwind passage.

=== Options

. Detect Boundary Unchecked
. Currents Unchecked

=== Data Source

. First use a freshly downloaded grib of the entire route area (a little
larger than then route), making sure that it is for a big enough time
interval. Then set the Grib_pi at least one frame later than the start
time.
. Grib Unchecked - You will need to check this.
. Climatology Disabled - You can leave this disabled when you are
starting. You can run routes using Climatology alone, or you can use the
30 year Noaa data averages to extend calculations for a long trip both
at the start and finish. There will be an indicator on the preferred
route when the data source changes.
. Last Valid if Data Deficient - Unchecked If your grib file is not long
enough checking this can help.
